# Borrowing a Language 101 and Ideas for Fantastic ((un)real) Speech

A talk and a workshop I gave at Ropecon in Helsinki in summer of 2024. 
Slides for the talk (in Finnish) are [here](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2024/blob/main/borrowing_a_language.pdf). 
The workshop was purely interactive this year, so there are no slides.

These evolved from two talks at [Indiana Comicon 2022 (slides in English)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022) 
and have been part of the program at Ropecon in also at least 
[2023 (slides in Finnish)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2023):

- Borrowing a language 101 
  was my second take on the question of what all needs to be considered when borrowing an existing
  language for a fictional setting and was delivered as a talk.
- Ideas for Fantastic ((un)real) Speech 
  on the other hand was my second take on how to generate
  interesting material for a fantasy setting by selectively applying constraints of the world itself,
  speech science -- especially articulation, because this is me -- and needs of the story, and was delivered as workshop.
- Combined slides are [here (pdf)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2022/blob/main/borrowing_a_language.pdf).
  Both programs were advertised as English and Finnish versions at separate times during the convention. Slides were only in English,
  but I translated them in to Finnish the following year for [Ropecon 2023](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2023).
