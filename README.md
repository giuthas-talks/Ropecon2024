# Borrowing a Language 101 and Ideas for Fantastic ((un)real) Speech

Two talks and two workshops workshop I gave at Ropecon in Helsinki in summer of 2022. These evolved 
from two talks at [Indiana Comicon 2022 (slides in English)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022) 
and have been part of the program at Ropecon in also at least 
[2023 (slides in Finnish)](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2023):

- [Borrowing a language 101 [pdf]](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022/blob/main/Borrowing/borrowing_a_language.pdf)
  was my second take on the question of what all needs to be considered when borrowing an existing
  language for a fictional setting and was delivered as a talk.
- [Ideas for Fantastic ((un)real) Speech [pdf]](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Comicon2022/blob/main/Unreal/ideas_for_fantastic_speech.pdf)
  on the other hand was my second take on how to generate
  interesting material for a fantasy setting by selectively applying constraints of the world itself,
  speech science -- especially articulation, because this is me -- and needs of the story, and was delivered as workshop.

Both programs were advertised as English and Finnish versions at separate times during the convention. Slides were only in English, 
but I translated them in to Finnish the following year for 
[Ropecon 2023](https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Ropecon2023).
